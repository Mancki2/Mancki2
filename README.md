### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
    
    My name is Joshua Galvez, I am studying at Florida International University and plan to graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science by 2024.
    
    I am fluent in Java, and am currently learning the basics of Python with my sights set on C++ as my next language to tackle
    
    For my coursework, I am working on a group project with classmates with an end goal of producing a functional piece of software that anyone can use if they meet the system requirements.
    
    While I am still learning, I love doing so, and am looking forward to learning more as the future draws nearer.
