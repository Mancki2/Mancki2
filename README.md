### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
    
My name is Joshua Galvez, I am studying at Florida International University and plan to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science by 2024.
    
    I am proficient in Java, Python, JS, HTML and CSS. I am currently learning the fundamentals of C for Systems Programming.
    
For my coursework, I have taken various core classes, including but not limited to: Programming 1 and 2, Data Structures and Software Engineering 1. In my  Software Engineering course, I worked on a group project with fellow classmates called "WordVeil" as shown in my repositories; we collectively participated in the final product over the course of the class; updating the project through various deliverables leading up to a final presentation showcasing our project.
    
    While I am still learning every day, I love doing so, and am looking forward to learning more as I expand my horizons.
